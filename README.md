# CertificatePasswordRecovery

This repository holds the code for a simple tool that can be used to brute-force encryption keys to unlock private keys from .pfx files.

Publishing this in the hopes it'll be helpful to someone - and because it's easier to host samples here than on my blog :)

Note, that brute-forcing passwords is, in any case, very slow.
